# Exercise 1

###1. Interrupts, I/O
* What is an interrupt? How can the system detect it?
  * *An interrupt is a mechanism by which other modules(I/O, memory) may interrupt the normal sequencing of the processor.*
  * *The instruction cycle contains an *interrupt stage*, whichis used to check for and handle interrupts*
* What may cause interrupt/exception? In what situations? What happens in the system then?
  * *Modules like I/O and memory*
  * *When that modules has finished processing and is ready to accept/provide new data*
  * *The processor finishes execution of the current instruction*
* What is the most common I/O technique used in the modern computers? How does it work?
  * *The most common I/O technique used in modern computers is DMA (Direct Memory Access)*
  * *It works by passing all required information to a DMA Module (read/write, address of I/O, starting location of memory and count of words), which then transfers the data to/from memory*

###2. Program execution
* Sta12 Problem 1.2: The register level program execution of Figure 1.4 (lect01, slide 19) is described in the text using six steps. Expand this register level program execution to show the use of the MAR and MBR.
  * *The MAR always containst the memory address for the next memory operation. In thi figure it contains the values 300, 940, 301, 941, 302, 941*
  * *And the MBR contains the data to be written/read, iin this case: 1940, 0003, 5941, 0005, 2941, 0005*
* Sta12 Problem 1.3: Consider a hypothetical 32-bit microprocessor having 32-bit instructions composed of two fields. The first byte contains the opcode and the remainder an immediate operand or an operand address.
  * What is ther maximum directly addressable memory capacity (in bytes)?
    * *32 bits: 4 bits opcode, 28 bits address*
    * *2^28 words of memory directly accessible*
  * Discuss the impact on the system speed (in terms of number of memory ops) if the microprocessor has
    * a 32-bit local address bus and a 16-bit local data bus, or
    * a 16-bit local address bus and a 16-bit local data bus.
  * How many bits are needed for the program counter and the instruction register?
    * *32 bits for the IR and 28 bits for the PC*

###3. User mode vs kernel mode
* What is the difference between kernel and user mode? Explain why having two distinct modes aids in designing an operating system.
  * *In user mode some parts of the memory are access protected and some instructions may not be executed*
  * *In kernel mode privileged instructions may be run and protected memory areas may be accessed*
  * *because chaos would ensue*
* Which of the following instructions should be allowed to execute only in kernel mode? (a) disable all interrupts, (b) read the time-of-day clock, (c) set the time-of-day clock, (d) change the memory map?
  * *a and d*

###4. OS overview
* What is the difference between OS and OS kernel?
* What is the relationship between multithreading, multicore, and SMP?
  * *Multithreading is a technique in which a process is divided  into threads that can run concurrently*
  * *Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) refers to a computer hardware architecture and the OS behavioure linked to that design. The OS schedules processes or threads across all the available processors*
  * *A Multicore computer combines 2 or more processors on a single die.*
  * *The relationship between these is the intention to make processing faster without worrying about uniprocessor evolution*
* Explain the difference between a monolithic kernel and a microkernel.
  * *A large monolithic kernel constitues everything related to the OS and is typically implemented as a singel process, with all elements sharing the same address space*
  * *A microkernel only implements few essentials functions to the kernel (address spaces, interprocess communication and basic scheduling). All other services are provided by processses, called servers, that operate in user mode*
* Sta12 Problem 2.2: An I/O-bound problem is one that, if run alone, would spend more time waiting for I/O than using a processor. A processor-bound program is opposite. Suppose a short term scheduling algorithm favors those programs that have used little processor time in the recent past. Explain why this algorithm favors I/O-bound programs and yet does not permanently deny processor time from processor-bound programs.

###5. Cache
* In a CPU, cache access time is 500 ns and main memory access time is 2 Âµs. If a block is found, on average, 90% of the time in cache, what is the average access time?
  * *0.9 &times; 500 + 0.1 &times; 2500 = 700*
* Continuing the preceeding a part, but varying the average cache hit ratio, make table with 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% and 99% averages. What can you deduce from the numbers?
* Sta12 Problem 1.13: A computer has a cache, main memory, and a disk used for virtual memory. If a referenced word is in cache, 20 ns are required to access it. If it is in main memory, but not in * cache, 60 nc are needed to load it into the cache (including the original time to check the cache), and then the reference is started again. If the word is not in main memory, 12 ms are required to fetch it from the disk, followed by 60 ns to copy it to cahce, and then reference is started again. The cache hit ratio is 0.9 and the main memory hit ration is 0.6. What is the average time in ns required to access a referenced word in this system?

###6. Virtualization
* How does virtual memory relate to physical memory? When would you want to use it? When not?
* What is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM)? Give a practical example relating to Linux fork() system command when host operating system is Windows.
* What is a Process Virtual Machine (Fig. 2.14a, Le01 slide 55)? When would you want to use it?
* What is a System Virtual Machine (Fig. 2.14b, Le01 slide 56)? When would you want to use it?
* If you would want to run concurrently many applications with different operating systems, would you use a process or a system VM?
